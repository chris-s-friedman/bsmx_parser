# BSMX Parser

Parser for bsmx files from [Beersmith 3](http://beersmith.com/), written in python. The idea here is to expose the data housed in the numerous bsmx files created by beersmith and then expose them in python and then potentially put them in a relational database, or be available for access for other uses.
